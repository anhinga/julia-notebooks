(the conference site requested a biography; I decided to sketch a very brief one.)

### main theme

My main research focus has been to find, study, and develop a high-level computer programming formalism
allowing to deform programs in a continuous fashion (just as one can deform recurrent neural networks in a continuous fashion).

I was trying to approach this problem from various angles: doing research in the mathematics of continuous domains
for denotational semantics of programming languages, studying theoretical neuroscience, and so on.

Finally, our research collaboration was starting to see the hints of the possible solution from approximately Fall of 2012,
and the formalism for continuously deformable programs was developed by our collaboration in 2015-2016. 

These days I am continuing to focus on studying and experimenting with this formalism and I am hoping that it will
eventually stop being a purely research subject and will become a technology.

I maintain a Web site for this formalism here: https://anhinga.github.io/

### timeline

My background in software, mathematics, and science goes back to Soviet Union, to machine code, Algol-60, Fortran-4,
and to punched cards; to Puschino, the Biological Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and to
the Mathematical class of Moscow High School number 7.

I started to focus on continuous models of computations in college, then emigrated to USA, worked as
a scientfic programmer for Biosym Technologies doing computational geometry and computational chemistry
(I was the second author on several papers in _The Journal of Physical Chemistry_ and _Biophysical Chemistry_
from that period), then did a PhD in Computer Science at Brandeis University focusing of mathematics
of continuous domains for denotational semantics (this is a copy of my 2002 PhD thesis: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03868).

In parallel, I worked in various places in the software industry.
