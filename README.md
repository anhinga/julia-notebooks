### various Julia Jupyter notebooks

To use Julia within Jupyter notebooks one needs to have Anaconda installed (for Jupyter), to have a version of Julia installed and then to add `IJulia` package:

https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl

Then when one creates a new Jupyter notebook, one would have an option to create it in Julia.

If one adds `IJulia` package for multiple versions of Julia, one would be able to choose among those versions each time one creates a new Jupyter notebook in a browser.

### Displaying Jupyter notebooks in GitHub

Sometimes, GitHub does not render Jupyter notebooks correctly. If you encounter this problem, use `nbviewer`.

See https://github.com/anhinga/github-tests for details.
